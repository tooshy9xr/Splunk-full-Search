Comprehensive Threat Technique Reference & Splunk Correlation  
(Windows • Linux • Cloud)

---

## 📁 Folder Context (Professional Description)

The **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** module provides a **structured framework to map Splunk searches, detections, and threat hunting activities** to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.  
This ensures **alignment with industry-standard tactics and techniques**, enabling:

- Unified detection coverage  
- Threat intelligence correlation  
- Security program maturity measurement  
- SOC reporting and audit readiness

It is a **foundational reference** for all advanced search, behavioral analytics, and attack simulation projects.

## 🧠 Best Practices for MITRE Mapping

1. **Maintain platform context** – Different tactics manifest differently on Windows, Linux, and Cloud.  
2. **Correlate detection sources** – Combine endpoint, network, authentication, and cloud logs.  
3. **Prioritize high-risk techniques** – Focus on high-severity and high-likelihood attacks.  
4. **Continuously update** – MITRE ATT&CK evolves; ensure mappings reflect new techniques.  
5. **Integrate with Splunk Enterprise Security** – Use correlation searches and threat intelligence lookups.

## 🔍 Use Cases

- **SOC Coverage Assessment:** Identify which MITRE techniques are actively monitored.  
- **Threat Hunting:** Select searches based on targeted tactics.  
- **Red Team Validation:** Compare emulated attack techniques against detection coverage.  
- **Incident Response:** Quickly map observed activity to tactics and techniques for reporting.  

---

## 🛡️ Benefits

- Standardized language for threats across teams  
- Improved detection engineering & search prioritization  
- Streamlined reporting & auditing  
- Cross-platform visibility (Windows, Linux, Cloud)
