# 🚀🧠 Advanced Searches (AS) – Splunk Mastery

The **Advanced Searches (AS)** section is designed to cover **deep, complex, and real-world Splunk search use cases**.  
This part goes far beyond basic monitoring and focuses on **correlation, behavioral analysis, threat hunting, and large-scale data analytics**.

This folder represents the **core intelligence layer** of your Splunk project.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Advanced Searches
- Build **complex SPL logic** for real SOC environments  
- Detect **advanced threats and stealthy attacks**  
- Correlate **multiple data sources** into single detections  
- Enable **threat hunting & behavioral analytics**  
- Serve as a **professional reference** for blue teams & analysts

## 🧠 What Makes This Section “Advanced”
✔ Multi-source correlation  
✔ Time-based & statistical analysis  
✔ Behavioral baselining  
✔ Anomaly detection  
✔ Threat intelligence enrichment  
✔ SOC-ready detection logic

## 📌 Important Notes
- This section **assumes solid Fundamental Search knowledge**
- Focus is on **what to detect**, not just *how*
- Each detection should answer:
  - ❓ What is happening?
  - ❓ Why is it suspicious?
  - ❓ What does it indicate?
